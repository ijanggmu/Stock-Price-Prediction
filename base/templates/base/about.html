        <h1>We are team </h1>
        <p>Strategists are rocking 5,000-plus calls for year-end S&P 500 targets. What pandemic (said tongue-in-cheek)? Profit estimates by analysts remain on an uptrend, as if to laugh at the real threats of stubborn inflation. Stock valuations are well above historical norms ahead of interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Just money chasing money at this point, right? The pipeline of IPOs and deals look strong, too â€” which could help to keep a bid under many companies.</p>
